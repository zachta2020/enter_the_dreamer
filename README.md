# Enter the Dreamer

Once, there was a boy that was shown the way to the world beyond sleep, the Dreaming Realms, by his friends. Now, he explores the world of dreams as Enter the Dreamer, beholding its many wonders and mysteries while fighting against the sinister Nightmare Court.

The theme of this set of stages is a war in the Chesslands, a chessboard brought to life with white and black pieces in eternal conflict. The tide of war has turned, and the black pieces have the upper hand after myteriously becoming stronger and more ruthless. The White King calls upon Enter to make his way across the board, and find out what happened to the Black Kingdom.
